    <img src="brownie.jpeg">
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Baking off a pan of brownies and sandwiching your favorite ice cream between them is the easiest way to have a frozen treat ready to go all summer long. The classic pairing of a chocolate brownie and vanilla ice cream is hard to beat, but just about any ice cream would be good here.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1(16-oz.) box brownie mix, plus ingredients called for on box</li>
        <li>2 cupsvanilla ice cream, softened</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350Â°. Line a 13" x 9" baking pan with parchment, leaving an overhang on 2 long opposite sides. Grease with cooking spray. In a large bowl, prepare brownie batter according to package directions. Pour into prepared pan; spread in an even layer.</li>
        <li>Bake brownies until a tester inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs attached, 20 to 24 minutes. Let cool.</li>
        <li>Using parchment overhang, remove brownies from pan. Line same pan with parchment, leaving an overhang on 2 long opposite sides.</li>
        <li>Cut brownie in half and freeze until ready to serve, at least 2 hours or up to 1 month.</li>
        <li>Using parchment overhang, lift sandwiches out of pan. Serve immediately or return to freezer.</li>
